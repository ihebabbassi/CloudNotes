- On-demand delivery of IT resources. Can scale up and down based on needs.
- Fosters agility (number one reason why customers switch to cloud computing): Speed (global reach), experimentation (operations as code, templated environments with CloudFormation) and culture of innovation (experiment quickly with low cost)
